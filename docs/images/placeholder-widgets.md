   - Should show a list of files with permission indicators
   - Include search bar and filters
   - Show file names, sizes, dates, and permission summaries

2. **widget-file-editor.png** - Screenshot of the file editor widget when displaying a SyftFile object
   - Should show file content viewer/editor
